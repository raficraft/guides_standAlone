Facilitate your integration work
--------------------------------

**Guide.js** is the first tool in a series of four. This will allow the front-end developer to improve their **working comfort and productivity**.

Guide.js allows you to insert guides to change their **thickness, color and position** in order to easily align the elements of your page. This feature is directly inspired by the one that can be found in **Photoshop**. ^^

The project is completely made **from scratch** and has no dependencies. And it will be the same for the next modules.

## Demo 

You can test the plugin directly, at the following address:

```
Then you just need to import the module into your index.js or main.js file. The script is compatible with REACT.JS

```
