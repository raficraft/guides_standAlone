Facilitate your integration work
--------------------------------

**Guide.js** is the first tool in a series of four. This will allow the front-end developer to improve their **working comfort and productivity**.

Guide.js allows you to insert guides to change their **thickness, color and position** in order to easily align the elements of your page. This feature is directly inspired by the one that can be found in **Photoshop**. ^^

The project is completely made **from scratch** and has no dependencies. And it will be the same for the next modules.
***
## Demo 

You can test the plugin directly, at the following address:
[Live Demo](https://flamboyant-saha-06f6cd.netlify.app/)
***
## Installation

```javascript
npm i guides_js_by_raficraft
```
Then you just need to import the module into your index.js or main.js file. The script is compatible with REACT.JS. Since the script is in vanilla JS, it is probably also compatible with Vue.js
```javascript
import guides from 'guides_js_by_raficraft'
```

### How to use


*   Use **ctrl** or **shift** key and **left click** in the page to add a **horizontal** or **vertical** Guides.
